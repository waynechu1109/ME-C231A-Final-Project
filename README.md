## Abstract
Our energy-efficient flight path optimization system addresses the environmental impact of air transportation by dynamically optimizing flight paths in real-time through MPC. The system minimizes energy consumption, incorporating advanced control algorithms to revolutionize aircraft navigation for a more sustainable aviation landscape. Considering forces applied on the aircraft during flight, linearization transforms the physical motion model into a mathematical one for computational optimization. The cost function, reflecting energy consumption, is optimized with terminal constraints tailored to operational objectives. Feasibility is assessed using the maximum control invariant set ($C_\infty$). Simulation results show adaptability and potential fuel savings, emphasizing the system's contribution to sustainable aviation practices and MPC's role in shaping fuel-efficient air transportation systems.
